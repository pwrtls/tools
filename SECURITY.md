# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The Power Tools project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report a Security Issue

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report security issues directly to our security team:

- **Email**: [security@powertools.dev](mailto:security@powertools.dev)
- **PGP Key**: Available on request for encrypted communications
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge security reports within 24 hours

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of issue**: (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Affected component**: (e.g., specific tool, API endpoint, authentication system)
- **Version affected**: (include version number if known)
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps that demonstrate the vulnerability
- **Impact assessment**: What could an attacker do with this vulnerability?
- **Potential mitigations**: Any suggestions for fixing the issue
- **Your environment**: Browser, OS, Power Platform version, etc.

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Initial Report**: Send your vulnerability report to security@powertools.dev
2. **Acknowledgment**: We'll respond within 24 hours confirming receipt
3. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the report (typically 1-3 days)
4. **Status Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our investigation progress
5. **Fix Development**: If confirmed, we'll develop a fix (timeline depends on complexity)
6. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
7. **Public Notification**: After fix deployment, we'll notify the community

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
|---------|--------------------|-------|
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            | Current stable release |
| 0.9.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited        | Critical issues only |
| < 0.9   | ‚ùå No             | End of life |

## Security Considerations for Contributors

### When Contributing Code

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- All API endpoints must validate authentication tokens
- Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- Never store plaintext credentials or sensitive data
- Use secure session management practices

**Data Handling:**
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Avoid logging sensitive information

**API Security:**
- Implement rate limiting on all public APIs
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies

### Security Headers

All Power Tools applications should implement these security headers:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update all dependencies to address known vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `npm audit` and `snyk` for vulnerability scanning
- Avoid including unnecessary dependencies
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

## Testing for Security

### Security Test Checklist

**Before submitting code, verify:**

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all user-controlled data
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] XSS prevention measures in place
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented where needed
- [ ] Authentication checks on all protected routes
- [ ] Authorization checks for resource access
- [ ] Secure headers implemented
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and scanned
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

### Security Testing Tools

We recommend using these tools for security testing:

- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security plugins, SonarQube
- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check
- **Dynamic Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Community Edition
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks, TruffleHog

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that:

1. **Don't exploit vulnerabilities** you discover
2. **Don't share details** until they've been fixed and disclosed
3. **Give us reasonable time** to fix issues before public disclosure
4. **Work with us** on coordinated disclosure timing

## Recognition

We recognize and thank security researchers who help improve Power Tools security:

- **Security researchers** who report vulnerabilities will be credited (with permission)
- **Contributors** who implement security fixes are recognized in release notes
- **Community members** who help with security testing receive special mentions
