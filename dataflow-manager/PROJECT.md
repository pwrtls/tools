# Dataflow Manager - Project Document

## Project Overview

The Dataflow Manager is a Power Tools application designed to simplify the management of Power Query dataflow ownership across Power Platform environments. This tool addresses the common administrative need to reassign dataflow ownership when users leave organizations or when responsibilities change.

## Problem Statement

Power Platform administrators often need to:
- View all dataflows across their environment
- Identify current ownership of dataflows
- Reassign dataflow ownership to new users
- Manage dataflow ownership at scale

Currently, this process requires manual intervention through multiple interfaces or complex API calls, making it time-consuming and error-prone for administrators.

## Solution

The Dataflow Manager provides a centralized, user-friendly interface that allows administrators to:
1. **View All Dataflows**: Display a comprehensive list of all dataflows in the connected environment
2. **See Ownership Information**: Show current owner details including name and email
3. **Assign New Owners**: Select from available users and reassign dataflow ownership
4. **Track Changes**: Monitor ownership changes with real-time updates

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Dataflow Listing**: Displays all active dataflows with key metadata
- **User Selection**: Provides searchable dropdown of available users
- **Ownership Transfer**: Executes ownership changes via Power Query API
- **Real-time Updates**: Reflects changes immediately in the interface

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern UI using Ant Design components
- **Search and Filter**: Quick access to specific dataflows and users
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and fallback behaviors

### Technical Features
- **PowerTools Integration**: Seamless integration with PowerTools framework
- **API Integration**: Direct calls to Dataverse and Power Query APIs
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Performance**: Optimized data loading and caching

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19.1.0**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript 4.9.5**: Type-safe development
- **Ant Design 5.25.4**: Professional UI component library
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing

### API Integration
- **PowerTools Framework**: Authentication and API access
- **Dataverse Web API**: Fetching dataflows and users
- **Power Query API**: Updating dataflow ownership

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: PowerTools handles environment connection
2. **Data Fetching**: Parallel API calls to get dataflows and users
3. **User Interaction**: Modal-based ownership assignment workflow
4. **API Updates**: Direct calls to Power Query update-owner endpoint
5. **State Management**: Local state updates for immediate feedback

## API Endpoints Used

### Dataverse Web API
- `GET /api/data/v9.2/msdyn_dataflows` - Fetch dataflows
- `GET /api/data/v9.2/systemusers` - Fetch users

### Power Query API
- `POST https://us.prod.powerquery.microsoft.com/api/dataflow/group/{groupId}/dataflow/{dataflowId}/update-owner` - Update ownership

## Data Models

### IDataflow
```typescript
interface IDataflow {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    owner?: {
        id: string;
        name: string;
        email?: string;
    };
    modifiedDateTime?: string;
    createdDateTime?: string;
    workspaceId?: string;
    workspaceName?: string;
}
```

### IUser
```typescript
interface IUser {
    id: string; // Primary ID (Azure AD Object ID preferred, fallback to systemuserid)
    systemUserId?: string; // Dataverse system user ID
    azureAdObjectId?: string; // Azure AD Object ID
    name: string;
    email?: string;
    userPrincipalName?: string;
}
```

### IDataflowOwnerUpdateRequest
```typescript
interface IDataflowOwnerUpdateRequest {
    newOwnerName: string;
    newOwnerUserId: string;
    previousOwnerUserId: string;
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All API calls are authenticated through PowerTools framework
- User permissions are respected based on Power Platform environment access
- No direct credential handling in the application

### Authorization
- Users must have appropriate permissions to view dataflows
- Ownership changes require sufficient privileges in the Power Platform environment
- API calls are made with the authenticated user's context

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data is stored locally
- All API communications use HTTPS
- User data is only displayed, not persisted

### User ID Mapping Architecture
- **Critical Design Note**: The Power Query API requires Azure AD Object IDs for ownership changes
- Dataverse systemuser table contains both `systemuserid` and `azureactivedirectoryobjectid` fields
- Users are fetched using both fields and stored in enhanced IUser interface
- **Owner Display Logic**: Dataflow `_ownerid_value` (system user ID) → match `systemUserId` → display user name
- **Owner Update Logic**: Current owner system user ID → lookup `azureAdObjectId` → use in API calls
- Fallback mechanisms ensure compatibility if Azure AD Object ID is unavailable
- Optimized lookup minimizes API calls by using in-memory user data when possible

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, API, and business logic
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and type checking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Efficient data loading and state management

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test API interactions and data flow
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Validate end-to-end workflows
- **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling and edge cases

### Deployment
- **Build Process**: Standard React build pipeline
- **PowerTools Integration**: Must be deployed within PowerTools framework
- **Environment Configuration**: No environment-specific configuration required

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and update multiple dataflows at once
- **Audit Trail**: Track ownership change history
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by owner, workspace, or date ranges
- **Export Functionality**: Export dataflow ownership reports

### Technical Improvements
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching for better performance
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Offline Support**: Basic offline functionality for viewing data
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced accessibility features

## Success Metrics
