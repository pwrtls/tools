## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Overview

Power Tools are built as React applications that integrate with the PowerTools UI framework. Key principles:

- **Framework Integration**: Tools must use PowerTools Context for API access
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage shared UI components for consistency
- **Authentication**: Use framework-provided authentication
- **Context Management**: Utilize environment and user context

### Project Structure

Each tool should follow this structure:

```
tool-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx          # Entry point
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppRouter.tsx      # Routing configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/            # TypeScript interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/             # Main view components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/               # API service functions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ powertools/        # Framework integration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # HTML template with PowerTools script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Tool documentation
```

## Tool Development

### Creating a New Tool

1. **Create tool directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir tools/your-tool-name
   cd tools/your-tool-name
   ```

2. **Initialize React project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app . --template typescript
   ```

3. **Install PowerTools dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @ant-design/icons antd axios react-router-dom
   ```

4. **Add PowerTools integration** to `public/index.html`:
   ```html
   <head>
     <script src="../../src/powertools/powertools-api.js"></script>
   </head>
   ```

5. **Follow the project structure** outlined above

### PowerTools Integration Requirements

- **Use PowerTools Context** for all API calls
- **Implement proper error handling** for authentication failures
- **Follow UI/UX guidelines** for consistency
- **Test with real Power Platform environments**

### UI/UX Guidelines

- **Use Ant Design components** for consistency
- **Follow responsive design** principles
- **Implement proper loading states** and error handling
- **Ensure accessibility** compliance
- **Use consistent color scheme** and typography

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Use strict TypeScript** configuration
- **Define interfaces** for all data models
- **Use proper typing** for function parameters and returns
- **Avoid `any` types** unless absolutely necessary

### React Best Practices

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Implement proper state management**
- **Use React.memo** for performance optimization
- **Follow component composition** patterns

### Code Style

- **Use consistent indentation** (2 spaces)
- **Follow ESLint rules** and fix all warnings
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Keep functions small** and focused

## Testing Requirements

### Local Testing

1. **Build and run locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test with PowerTools framework**:
   - Use development server for integration testing
   - Test with real Dynamics 365 environment
   - Verify authentication flows

3. **Check browser console** for errors
4. **Test responsive design** on different screen sizes

### Test Cases

- **Authentication**: Test with different user roles
- **API Integration**: Verify data retrieval and error handling
- **UI Components**: Test interaction patterns and edge cases
- **Performance**: Test with large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Tool loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication works correctly
- [ ] API calls succeed and fail gracefully
- [ ] UI components respond properly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design works
- [ ] Accessibility features function
