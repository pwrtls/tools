**Power Tools is an extensible, cross-platform toolkit for developers, power users, and analysts working with the Microsoft Power Platform.**

</div>

## 🌟 What is Power Tools?

Think of it as a modern, web-based alternative to `XrmToolBox`. Our platform provides a secure wrapper for Dataverse APIs, admin APIs, and Power Query APIs, enabling a community of builders to create and share tools that simplify complex tasks and daily workflows.

While developers will appreciate the streamlined environment, the tools themselves are designed to empower anyone who needs to interact with Power Platform data and metadata in a more sophisticated way.

### ✨ Key Advantages

- **🌐 Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **🚀 Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, and web technologies
- **👥 Community-Driven**: Open source with active community contributions
- **🔧 Extensible**: Easy to build and share new tools
- **🛡️ Secure**: Enterprise-grade security for Power Platform access
